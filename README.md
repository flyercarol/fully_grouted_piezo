# Fully grouted piezometer
- Acquisition code for fully grouted piezometer constructed based on open-source Arduino hardware and some peripheral modules.
- Fully grouted piezometer is piezometer being grouted into borehole but with permeable grout that allows the formation head pressure to reach piezometers themselves.
- The fully grouted method also makes it feasible to install multiple piezometers and to install piezometers together with other instruments in a single borehole.
